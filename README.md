# Steam Deck C++ Installer

# Introduction

Hello! If you are anything like me you have probably struggled to configure C++ to
run on the ArchLinux build that is SteamOS.

I had a hell of a time figuring this out on my first go around, and felt there was 
a need to automate this process for everyone

This script implements two shell files as well as a python script that parses information

The program does everything you need in an unboxed steamdeck to install C++ as well as any
missing Linux header information that was so rudely removed fromt the Steam Deck build of Linux
